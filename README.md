# PathpointConfigs

A repository for various configs that will work on Demotron V2 New Relic Account.  Since PathPoint configurations are separate form code, we need a structure to keep our relevant configs properly version controlled.  These configs are mainly for demonsration and test instances.

Use the accounts folder to organize one or more configs under the correct account name.
